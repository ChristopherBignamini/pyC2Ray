class SourceGroup:
    """Container for a set of sources grouped for joint processing.

    A source group represents a set of sources that are grouped together for
    joint processing in the domain decomposition. This group is defined as a
    list of sources and a region of influence of the group itself which, in
    the current implementation, is represented by a sphere enclosing the
    spheres of influence of the single sources. In the future, more complex
    shapes could be used to better fit the actual region of influence of the
    group, such as a convex hull of the spheres of influence of the single
    sources, or even the actual union of the spheres of influence of the single
    sources.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        Global group identifier.
    sources : list[Source]

    center : np.ndarray
        Center of the enclosing sphere of grouped source spheres.

    radius : float
        (in physical coordinates).
        Radius of the enclosing sphere.
